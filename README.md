# **What is DevOps?** ü§î

Before we dive deep into DevOps, let's first understand **why DevOps exists**.

- DevOps is **not just a tool** or a **single technology**.
- It is a **combination of culture, practices, and tools** that help organizations **deliver applications and services faster and more reliably**.

DevOps **bridges the gap** between **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** to ensure smooth and **automated software delivery**.

# **The Evolution of Software Development** üîÑ

Before DevOps, organizations followed different software development methodologies. Let‚Äôs briefly discuss two major models:

---

## **1. Waterfall Model** üíß

The **Waterfall model** was one of the earliest software development methodologies. It follows a **linear and sequential approach**, where each phase must be **fully completed before moving to the next**.

### **Drawbacks of the Waterfall Model:**

‚ùå **Lack of Flexibility** ‚Äì Hard to accommodate changes once development starts.

‚ùå **Late Feedback Loop** ‚Äì Testing happens at the end, causing delays in identifying issues.

‚ùå **Time-Consuming** ‚Äì Progress is sequential, leading to longer development cycles.

*Example:* Imagine building a house where you first complete the entire structure before testing for any defects. If a major flaw is found, you must redo the entire construction.

---

## **2. Agile Model** ‚ö°

The **Agile methodology** improved upon Waterfall by allowing **incremental development** in **small, iterative cycles**.

### **Advantages of Agile:**

‚úÖ **Faster Development** ‚Äì Delivers smaller, working features quickly.

‚úÖ **Early Feedback** ‚Äì Customers and teams can give input during development.

‚úÖ **Better Adaptability** ‚Äì Changes can be incorporated at any stage.

### **Drawbacks of Agile:**

‚ùå **Requires High Collaboration** ‚Äì Needs strong coordination among team members.

‚ùå **Scope Creep** ‚Äì Continuous changes can cause the project to grow beyond expectations.

‚ùå **Less Predictable** ‚Äì Hard to estimate timelines and budgets accurately.

*Example:* Agile is like **building a mobile app in phases**, where a **basic version is released first**, and then new features are added based on user feedback.

# **Why DevOps?** üöÄ

Even with Agile, there was still a **gap between Developers and Operations teams**. DevOps solves this problem by integrating both sides.

Imagine you **develop an application** and run it **locally**. It works fine, but when you deploy it to production, you want it to be:

‚úÖ **Always up and running**

‚úÖ **Scalable and secure**

‚úÖ **Easily maintainable with automation**

This is where **DevOps plays a crucial role**!

DevOps helps in:

üîπ **Automating software builds, testing, and deployments**

üîπ **Monitoring applications in real-time**

üîπ **Scaling applications automatically**

üîπ **Ensuring security and compliance**

---

# **How Software is Built & Delivered?** üèóÔ∏è

Let‚Äôs go step by step through the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** to understand **how software is built and deployed**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Planning**

- Define project goals, features, and timelines.
- Identify business requirements and objectives.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Development (Coding)**

- Developers write code using programming languages like Python, Java, Go, etc.
- Code is stored in repositories like **GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Build & Test**

- The code is **compiled** into an executable format.
- Automated tests ensure the software **works correctly**.
- CI/CD tools like **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD** are used.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment**

- The application is deployed to **servers or cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Configuration management tools like **Ansible, Terraform, Helm** are used.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Feedback**

- Tools like **Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, ELK Stack** monitor system health.
- Alerts and logs help detect and resolve issues **quickly**.

**DevOps Principles :**

It's crucial to introduce the core principles that underpin DevOps:

- **Culture:** Fostering collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility between development and operations teams. "You build it, you run it" mentality.
- **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks throughout the SDLC to improve speed, reliability, and consistency.
- **Lean:** Minimizing waste and maximizing value by streamlining processes and eliminating unnecessary steps.
- **Measurement:** Tracking key metrics to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and drive continuous improvement.
- **Sharing:** Open communication and knowledge sharing among team members.
